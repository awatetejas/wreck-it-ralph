      <h2>About Vanellope von Schweetz</h2>
      <p>
        As a formerly bullied outcast,
        <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Vanellope_von_Schweetz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          <em>Vanellope</em>
        </a>
        is a feisty and determined young girl who has turned her struggles into strength. 
        Beneath her sharp wit and sarcastic exterior, she has a kind and loyal heart, especially toward her best friend Ralph, whom she sees as a fellow misfit. 
        She is resourceful and quick-thinking, able to build karts from scraps and outsmart opponents with creative plans. 
        Instead of letting her “glitch” define her as a flaw, Vanellope embraces it, transforming her imperfection into her greatest strength. 
        Her journey is one of self-acceptance and belonging, proving that being different can be a superpower.
